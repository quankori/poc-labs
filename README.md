# ðŸš€ Proof of Concept (PoC): Microservices & DevOps Exploration

Welcome to this Proof of Concept project! This repository demonstrates a modern, scalable architecture using cutting-edge tools and technologies. From a robust API layer to automated DevOps pipelines and performance testing, this PoC showcases a holistic approach to building and deploying microservices.

---

## ðŸ“š Project Structure

### API Layer

**Folder**: `/api`  
**Purpose**: The heart of the application, built as an Nx monorepo to manage multiple microservices efficiently.  
**Features**:

- **GraphQL**: Flexible and powerful API querying with `@nestjs/graphql`.
- **gRPC**: High-performance, type-safe communication between services.
- **Metrics**: Monitoring with Prometheus, integrated via `@willsoto/nestjs-prometheus`, visualized using Grafana.
- **ELK Stack**: Centralized logging with Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.
- **Kafka**: Event-driven architecture with Apache Kafka for asynchronous messaging.

**Tech Stack**:

- Nx Monorepo
- NestJS
- GraphQL, gRPC, Prometheus, ELK, Kafka

---

### DevOps Infrastructure

**Folder**: `/devops`  
**Purpose**: Automate deployment and infrastructure management for a production-ready environment.  
**Features**:

- **Docker**: Containerized services with custom-built images.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for provisioning cloud resources.
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy and load balancing for API traffic.
- **CI/CD**: Pipeline configurations for seamless builds and deployments.

**Tech Stack**:

- Docker
- Terraform
- Nginx
- CI/CD Tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins)

---

### Documentation

**Folder**: `/docs`  
**Purpose**: Capture knowledge and insights gained during development.  
**Features**:

- Detailed guides on new technologies explored.
- Best practices for integrating GraphQL, gRPC, and Kafka.
- Lessons learned from setting up monitoring and DevOps workflows.

**Goal**: Serve as a living resource for the team and future projects.

---

### Performance Testing

**Folder**: `/performance-testing`  
**Purpose**: Validate system reliability and scalability under load.  
**Features**:

- **Stress Testing**: Simulate high traffic with tools like **k6**.
- **API Testing**: Functional and performance tests using **Karate**.
- **Metrics Analysis**: Measure response times, throughput, and resource usage.

**Tech Stack**:

- k6
- Karate
- Custom scripts for load generation
